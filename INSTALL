Installing Technolust v1.0 - Copyright 2004 Micheal Waltz - ecliptik@gmail.com - http://www.ecliptik.com

REQUIREMENTS:

* Apache or IIS webserver with PHP 4.0 or higher enabled
* MySQL Database server version 3.23 or higher


NOTES:
This was developed on a GNU/Linux system running Apache 2 with PHP 4.8 and MySQL 4, but any recent versions of Apache, Mysql, PHP, and IIS regardless of Operating System should work without any problems.

Begin by untarring the technolust.tar.gz in a temporary directory, the contents are as follows:

README - Basic information about this application
INSTALL - This file
/includes - The actual working PHP files
/webroot - Web viewable files
/webroot/images - Images for default buttons

You need to know where you web viewable directory is, usually this is /var/www, /var/www/apache2-default on unix/linux/bsd systems. Consult your distributions documentation for the exact location. Windows systems can find this location in the IIS snap-in. If you have any files named the same as the ones in this application they will be overwritten, so be careful not to copy over something you want to keep.


WEBPAGE INSTALLATION
1. Edit the the header.php file in the includes directory, changing the Site Wide variables and mysql_password.

2. Move the entire includes directory to the directory underneath the web viewable one. Such as if the web viewable one is /var/www, move includes to /var.

	exp: /tmp/technolust/ $>mv -R includes /var/

3. Move the files and images directory in webroot to your systems web viewable directory, such as /var/www.

	exp: /tmp/technolust/webroot/ $> mv -R * /var/www/


MYSQL INSTALLATION:
Make sure you have mysql 3.23 or higher and the mysql daemon is running before trying these steps

Begin at your normal command line, then copy each command as they are shown

1. Log into your mysql database as root, if you do not have root access or creation privledges, please consult your system administrator.
mysql -u root -p

2. Run this command to create the webpage database
create database webpage;

3. Give permissions to the webmaster user and create a password
GRANT ALL ON webpage.* TO webmaster IDENTIFIED BY 'somepassword'

4. Use the just created database 
use webpage;

5. Create the category table
create table category (cat_id int unsigned not null auto_increment primary key, cat_name varchar(90) not null, cat_sum text not null, fulltext(cat_name, cat_sum));

6. Create the articles table
create table articles (art_id int unsigned not null auto_increment primary key, cat_id int unsigned not null, art_title varchar(90) not null, art_date varchar(60) not null, art_sum text not null, art_body text not null, fulltext(art_title, art_sum, art_body));

7. Quit mysql
quit;

8. Log back into mysql as the webmaster user from the command line
mysql -u webmaster -p

9. Use the webpage database
use webpage;

10. Describe the tables we just created
desc category;
desc articles;

11. Check to make sure they match to these:

FINISHING UP:
Once you've copied the PHP files and created your mysql database, point your webbrowser to http://127.0.0.1 or the webserver you installed on, to test the page comes up correctly.

To add/edit content, point your webbrowser to http://127.0.0.1/indexadmin.php or the webserver you installed on, and test adding/editing stories. The first category you make will become the front page and you cannot add any articles below.
